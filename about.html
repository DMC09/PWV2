      <div class="bio"> I am a self taught front-end developer and recent graduate from the Technololgy Management program at Texas A&M University. My first experience with Web Develpment was actually Wordpress website I did for my senior
        Internship. I had never used it before, but Wordpress made develpment so intuitive that it actually piqued my interest. Since then my curiosity and passion for web development has grown and I am searching for full-time front end opportunity
        to gain profesional experience.
